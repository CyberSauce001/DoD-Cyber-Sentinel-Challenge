## What is an ICAO Code?

The ICAO airport code, or location indicator, is a four-letter code designating aerodromes around the world. These codes, defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization, are used by air traffic control and airline operations such as flight planning.

## Task

You are given two images to determine the ICAO code. 

### Image Analysis

1. **First Image:** 
   - The photo appears to be an aerial view looking down on a field.

2. **Second Image:**
   - The photo resembles a military base with military aircraft on standby.

### Investigation

Using Google reverse image search, it appears that the images are related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. To narrow down the location, further investigation led to a tweet mentioning the Starokonstantinov airbase. The images closely match those found in the tweet.

The ICAO code for Starokonstantinov airbase is **UKLS**. Thus, the flag is:

**Flag:** C1{UKLS}
