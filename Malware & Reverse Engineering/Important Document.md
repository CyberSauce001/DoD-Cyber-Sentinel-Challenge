### Instructions

1. **Open the Web Page**: When you open the provided link, you will see an Excel login page requiring credentials to confirm your identity.

2. **View Page Source**: Inspect the page source of this login page. You will find a very long string of binary code.

3. **Decode Binary String**: 
   - Copy the entire binary string.
   - Use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and select the 'From Binary' operation to decode it.
   - You will get a strange JavaScript function.

4. **Deobfuscate JavaScript**: 
   - Use a JavaScript deobfuscator like [Obf.io](https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/) to make the script more readable.
   - Within the deobfuscated script, look for a line that displays a long hexToBytes string: 
     ```
     NDMzMTdiNjgzMDcwMzM1Zjc5MzA3NTVmNjQzMTY0NmU3NDVmNzU3MzMzNWYzNDVmNzIzNDMzMzE1ZjcwMzQ3MzczNzczMDcyNjQ3ZA==
     ```

5. **Decode Hex String**:
   - Copy this string and decode it using 'From Base64' in CyberChef.
   - This will result in another string:
     ```
     43317b683070335f7930755f6431646e745f7573335f345f723433315f70347373773072647d
     ```
   - Decode this string using 'From Hex' in CyberChef to reveal the flag.
